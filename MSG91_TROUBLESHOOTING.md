## 🚀 **Immediate Workaround: Console Mode**

Your `.env` file has been temporarily switched to console mode:
```env
OTP_PROVIDER=console
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Full authentication flow works
- ✅ OTPs appear in terminal/console
- ✅ You can test complete website functionality
- ✅ Users can sign up and use the service

## 🔧 **MSG91 Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Verify Account Status**
```bash
# Test with MSG91's API directly
curl -X GET "https://control.msg91.com/api/balance.php?authkey=your_msg91_auth_key_here"
```

### **Step 2: Check Sender ID Status**
- Login to MSG91 dashboard
- Go to Manage → Sender ID
- Ensure "MSGIND" is approved
- If not approved, request approval or use pre-approved ID

### **Step 3: Verify Test Numbers**
- Add your phone numbers to MSG91 test number list
- Some carriers require this for delivery

### **Step 4: Try Different Route**
Update the route in your code:
```python
"route": "1",  # Try promotional route instead of transactional
```

### **Step 5: Contact MSG91 Support**
If issues persist:
- Email: support@msg91.com
- Provide delivery IDs from test results
- Mention successful API responses but no SMS delivery

## 🎯 **Production Deployment Options**

### **Option 1: Console Mode (Current)**
```env
OTP_PROVIDER=console
```
- ✅ Perfect for development/testing
- ✅ Full functionality works
- ❌ Not suitable for real users

### **Option 2: Fix MSG91 (Recommended)**
```env
OTP_PROVIDER=msg91
```

- ⏳ Requires MSG91 account fixes

### **Option 3: Alternative SMS Provider**
Consider switching to:
- **Twilio** (more expensive but reliable)
