### Step 2: Start ngrok (In a NEW terminal)
Open a new PowerShell window and run:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\THARAN\Desktop\codedebhairemondata\flaskdeployment-main"
.\ngrok.exe http 5000
```

### Step 3: Copy the ngrok URL
You'll see something like:
```
Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:5000
```

Copy the https://abc123.ngrok.io URL (yours will be different)

Replace these lines in your .env file:
```
PAYMENT_RETURN_URL=https://codedebhai.com/payment/callback
PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://codedebhai.com/payment/webhook
```

With (replace YOUR_NGROK_URL with your actual ngrok URL):
```
PAYMENT_RETURN_URL=https://YOUR_NGROK_URL/payment/callback
PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://YOUR_NGROK_URL/payment/webhook
```

### Step 5: Restart Flask App
Stop your Flask app (Ctrl+C) and start it again:
```powershell
python app.py
```

### Step 6: Test Payment
Now your payment flow should work with Cashfree production!

## Example
If your ngrok URL is `https://abc123.ngrok.io`, then update .env to:
```
PAYMENT_RETURN_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/payment/callback
PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok.io/payment/webhook
```
